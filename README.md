This extends SVGs with the ability to edit, merge and save out SVGs on both Win, OSX and iOS.

Update Sep 18, 2016

+Changed name top ofxEditableSVG to prevent naming conflict with core addon

Update Oct 20, 2015

+Added rudimentary support for base64 images to be embedded in output SVG. No parsing or rendering yet though. Feel free to help out there. Current purpose was just to be able to embed pixel/font generated content in output SVG.
